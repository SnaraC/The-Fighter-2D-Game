# The-Fighter-2D-Game

Fighting 2D game developed by Unity cross-platform game engine. 

# Elevator Pitch

“Throwback to the 90s, experiencing a single and multiplayer arcade combat was one of the most 
memorable of our childhood. And now we have finally come up with a new arcade edition, “The
fighting 2D Game,” to live up to the old-school game. You take the role as a Strongest, a person with skills and 
powers to eliminate your opponents to conquer the best of the best. A magical, a fire, a legendary 
martial art are back, transforming the street into a chaotic battleground.”
